	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>
  In computer science, <strong>time complexity</strong> refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its execution as a function of the input size. It helps us analyze the efficiency of an algorithm, indicating how the algorithm's runtime increases as the input grows. An efficient algorithm strives for low time complexity, meaning it can handle larger inputs without causing a significant increase in execution time.

  <strong>Space Complexity</strong>, on the other hand, deals with the amount of memory space an algorithm uses to solve a problem based on the input size. It is essential to consider not only the time an algorithm takes but also the memory it consumes. One way to measure space complexity is by using Big O notation, which expresses an upper bound on the memory required in terms of the input size. For example, an algorithm with space complexity of O(n) indicates that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.
